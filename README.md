# JavaScript Template Strings Practice

### Exercise 1:

Create a variable called ```myName``` and assign it the value of your name as a String. Create a template string to format the output and log it to the console as 

```Hi, my name is YOURNAME``` 

For example, if the variable is equal to ```Kevin``` the output would be ```Hi, my name is Kevin```.

### Exercise 2:

Write a template String that will print out the sum of the 2 variables (do NOT use any other variables).
```
let one = 1;
let two = 2;
```

Log the sum to the console using your template string to produce ```Your total is: 3```


### Challenge:

Given the Object Literal variable below 
```var person = { first_name: 'Chuck', last_name: 'Jones' };```

Use a template string to print the Person's first and last name for example, ```Welcome to the site Chuck Jones!```
